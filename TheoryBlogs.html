                <h1>What is interaction for data visualization? </h1>
    
                <br>

                    In the study by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin, the question of what interaction for data visualization truly means is explored.
                     In the field of Human-Computer Interaction, interaction is described as a relationship between human and computer,
                      whilst visualization researchers prioritize the relationship between the data and the human.
                       After collecting and analyzing a vast number of visualization papers, Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin have
                        concluded that interaction in visualization is a broad topic, however, they have settled on a way to define and describe it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When it comes to the definition of interaction for data visualization,
                         they have identified mandatory components that interaction must include.
                          These components are the external and internal entities, 
                          and the external and internal actions. External entities involve the user and the data.
                           Internal actions are more goal oriented and focus on the user's achievements with the data.
                            With external actions, interaction is referred to as a dialogue between the user and the visualization.
                             The user communicates with the visualization system by making an input and the system communicates back by
                              responding to the user. Internal actions deal with how the user interprets the visualization system's responses. 
                              Interaction for data visualization is mainly goal oriented, that goal being to encourage the user to further
                         explore the data and without being confused or overwhelmed by the new information that is being discovered.

                    I will be analyzing the case study 'Words Invented or Coined by Shakespeare', 
                    from the information is beautiful webpage, in terms of its role as a semiotic device.
                     The case study shows a number of words that were either invented or coined by Shakespeare. The words are
                     clustered in a large circular shape in the middle of the page. They are also represented in different in colors and scales. 
                     <br>
                    <br>
                    On the page, it is revealed that the larger the word is, the more popular it is today.
                     Majority of the larger words are placed in the middle of the circle. Having larger items 
                     placed in the middle immediately draws your attention to it. The difference in sizes allows for
                     comparison among the words. The larger ones might be interpreted as more important because they what you see first. 
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     The words are also either in a grey color or an orange color. As the user hovers over word,
                      a small box pops up on the screen. As the user hovers over more words,
                       it is revealed that the words in orange have extra information about the word, where as the ones in grey do not.
                         Using different colors and sizes on the words encourages the user to explore why this is.  Using size to draw your attention
                      to the most important ones and color to differentiate between the one with extra information and the ones with out.
